Clima

Clima is a simple weather app that allows users to get current weather information for any location around the world. The app was built as part of a task in a Udemy course, and it makes use of HTTP requests, JSON parsing, and Core Location to provide accurate weather information.

Features

* Get current weather information for any location around the world
* Displays temperature in Celsius or Fahrenheit based on user preference
* User's current location can also be used to get weather information

Installation

* Clone the repository to your local machine
* Open the project in Xcode
* Build and run the app on a simulator or a physical device

Usage

* Upon opening the app, the user is presented with a search bar where they can enter a location to get weather information for.
* After the user enters a location and taps on the search button, the app makes an HTTP request to retrieve weather information for that location.
* The app displays the current weather information for the location on the screen, including temperature, weather condition, humidity, pressure, and wind speed.
* The user can also toggle between Celsius and Fahrenheit units by tapping on the temperature display.
* If the user allows location access, they can also tap on the location button to get weather information for their current location.
